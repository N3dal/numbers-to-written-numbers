# Numbers to Full-Written Number.

simple script to convert **'Integers'** and **'Floats'** to words
in simple words convert any number to the written form of it and
return it as **string**.

This project built with ![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-green) and ❤️.

**how it works**:
`121 => "one hundred and twenty-one"`
`3.14 => "three point fourteen".`

### how to use it:
``` py
    # num2written(your-number)

    written_number = num2written(1234)
    
    print(written_number)

    # Valid Inputs:

    num2written(1234)

    num2written("1234")

    num2written(12_345)

    num2written("12_345")

    num2written("-11_625")

    num2written(-11_625)


```


### TODO:

- [ ] make gui app using either tkinter or gtk.
- [ ] make it work for **Floating points** numbers.
- [ ] make the script accept args from the **Terminal** directly.
